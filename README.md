# Lane-Departure-Warning-System-with-OpenCV
his code uses OpenCV to detect lane lines and monitor lane position in a video. It applies a region of interest (ROI) mask, performs edge detection, and calculates lane deviations. Warnings are displayed if drifting is detected, with real-time feedback based on turn signal status.
